这是一个魔改版的魂三
This is a custom-engineered build of Dark Souls III.
对联机请求时的返回函数做了伪装，因此你可以随时和朋友一起快乐游玩DS3
The matchmaking response function has been cleverly disguised, allowing you to freely enjoy jolly cooperation with your friends in DS3
而不用担心被挂逼搞进神服 ( 本人曾在正常游玩时被死妈挂狗背刺到天上，以此受到栽赃封号 )
without worrying about being thrown into the “god-server purgatory” by certain “creative” players who think framing others for bans is a form of art.
并且禁用了官方原有的强制会话 ( 联机 ) 通道
The original forced session (P2P) channel has also been disabled.
因此遇到挂逼时只要屏蔽对方steam即可，不用再担心挂逼会强制进入你的世界搞你
So, if you ever meet one of those family-less network invaders, just block them on Steam — no more worrying about forced world-joining attacks.
禁用了帧数过低时的强制离线
The patch removes the forced offline mode that triggers when your framerate dips too low.
但仍然建议帧数低的玩家降低分辨率提高一些帧数获得更好的体验
Still, for your own sanity, I recommend lowering resolution if your FPS is potato-level — smoother frames, smoother death.
版本号从1.15.2更改为No ban
Version tag changed from 1.15.2 → “No ban.”

注意事项：魔改程序的大小和原文件是一样的！
⚙️ Notes (Read this before you download anything)
      The modified executable is exactly the same size as the original file.

所以请不要随便下载其他人分享的“疑似魔改程序”
That means — if you see anyone sharing a “magic DS3 EXE” with a suspiciously different size, don’t touch it.
里面可能会藏着危害病毒，就像以前私服时期的DDOS黑客攻击私服以此发邮件来勒索公益服主一样（甚至更严重）
It might be packed with something nasty.
Remember the good old private server days, when some self-proclaimed “hackers” launched DDoS attacks and then tried to blackmail community hosts through email?
Yeah… that kind of comedy still exists — only now it’s malware instead of packets.
备注：本人在私服时期也开过公益服务器，纯自费，未给过孤儿黑客一分钱
P.S. I used to run a public DS3 server back in those days — fully self-funded, never paid a single coin to those orphan-grade extortionists.
